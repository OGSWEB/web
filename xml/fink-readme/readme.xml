<p>
This is Fink, a package management system that aims to bring the full
world of GNU and other common Open Source software to Darwin and
Mac OS X.
</p>
<p>
With the help of dpkg, it maintains a separate directory hierarchy.
It downloads original source releases, patches them if neccessary,
configures them for Darwin and compiles and installs them.
The information about available packages and the neccessary patches
are included with this distribution, everything else is downloaded off
the Internet.
</p>
<p>
This is version 0.2.5, a development release.
It has rough edges everywhere, and lacks lots of useful features.
The package list is also quite short. You're walking on thin ground.
It could easily break your system (although it hasn't broken mine to
date).
You have been warned.
</p>
<p>
Fink is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
See the file COPYING for details.

<section name="req"><title>Requirements</title>
<p>
You need:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
An installed Mac OS X system, version 10.0 or later.
Darwin 1.3.1 should also work, but this has not been tested.
Earlier versions of both will <em>not</em> work.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Development tools.
On Mac OS X, install the Developer.pkg package from the Developer
Tools CD.
On Darwin, the tools should be present in the default install.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Many other things that come with Mac OS X and the Developer Tools.
This includes perl 5.6, wget and autoconf.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Internet access.
All source code is downloaded from mirror sites.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Patience.
Compiling several big packages takes time.
I'm talking hours or even days here.
</p></li>
</ul>
