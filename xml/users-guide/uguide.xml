<p>
You need:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
An installed Mac OS X system, version 10.0 or later, or equivalent
Darwin releases.
Earlier versions of both will <em>not</em> work.
See below for more information about supported systems.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Development tools.
On Mac OS X, install the Developer.pkg package from the Developer
Tools CD.
On Darwin, the tools should be present in the default install.

</p></li>
<li><p>
Many other things that come with Mac OS X and the Developer Tools.
This includes perl 5.6 and either wget or curl.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Internet access.
All source code is downloaded from mirror sites.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Patience.

I'm talking hours or even days here.

</ul>

<!--
(There may still be some stray linker-related problems with 10.1.)
Darwin 1.3.1 should also work, but this has not been tested.
