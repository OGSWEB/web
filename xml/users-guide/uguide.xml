Welcome to the Fink User's Guide.
This guide covers first time installation and upgrade procedures for
both the source and the binary distribution.
Package installation and maintenance is covered as well.

<chapter filename="intro">
<title>Introduction</title>
<shorttitle>Introduction</shorttitle>

<section name="what"><title>What is Fink?</title>
<p>
Fink is a distribution of Unix Open Source software for Mac OS X and
Darwin.
It brings free command-line and graphical software developed for Linux
and similar operating systems to your Mac.
</p>
</section>

<section name="req"><title>Requirements</title>
<p>
In any case you will need:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
An installed Mac OS X system, version 10.0 or later, or equivalent
Darwin releases.
Earlier versions of both will <em>not</em> work.
See below for more information about supported systems.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Internet access.
Both source code and binary packages are downloaded from Internet
download sites.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
If you intend to use the source distribution (see below), you will
also need:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
Development tools.
On Mac OS X, install the Developer.pkg package from the Developer
Tools CD.
On Darwin, the tools should be present in the default install.
</p>
<p>
Note that it's a good idea to have the Developer Tools installed even
if you don't intend to build packages from source.
Some of the tools installed by the package are actually general
purpose command line tools.
Some packages may depend on those to run.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Patience.
Compiling several big packages takes time.
I'm talking hours or even days here.
</p></li>
</ul>
</section>

<section name="supported-os"><title>Supported Systems</title>
<p>
<em>Mac OS X 10.0.x</em> is fully tested and supported at this point
in time.
It is strongly recommended that you upgrade to the latest update in
that series, 10.0.4, through the Software Update panel in the System
Preferences.
Note that support for 10.0.x may be dropped in the future when 10.1 is
in widespread use.
</p>
<p>
<em>Mac OS X 10.1</em> is in late beta-testing now.
The BSD subsystem and the development tools have seen significant
updates and we're still struggling to update all packages.
Expect to run into linker-related problems from time to time.
As of Fink 0.2.6, the majority of packages should work.
</p>
<p>
<em>Darwin 1.3.1</em> is the Darwin version corresponding to Mac OS X
10.0.x and should work as well.
However, this has not been tested as most people just run Mac OS X
proper instead.
You may run into problems with packages that use features specific to
Mac OS X - affected packages include XFree86 and possibly esound.
</p>
</section>

<section name="src-vs-bin"><title>Source vs. Binary</title>
<p>
Software is written in human-readable programming languages, called
the "source code".
When you buy commercial software you don't get to see the source code,
however.
All you get is the ready-to-run program (also called "executable" or
"binary").
</p>
<p>
Not so with Open Source software.
As the name implies, the source code is open for anyone to see and
modify.
In fact, most Open Source software is only distributed as source code
by its authors, and you must "compile" it on your computer to get a
program that can be run.
</p>
<p>
Fink lets you choose between the two models.
The "source" distribution will download the original source, adapt it
to Mac OS X and to Fink's policy, and compile it on your computer.
That process is fully automated, but takes some time.
The "binary" distribution on the other hand will download pre-compiled
packages from the Fink site and install those, saving you the time for
compiling.
It is actually possible to mix the two models at will.
The rest of this manual will show you how.

<chapter filename="install">
<title>First Time Installation</title>
<shorttitle>Install</shorttitle>

<preface>
<p>
During first time installation, a base system with the package
management tools is installed on your machine.
After that you must set up your shell environment to use the software
installed by Fink.
You only need to do this once; you can upgrade any Fink installation
(starting with release 0.2.0) in place, without reinstalling.
This is covered in the <xref chapter="upgrade">Upgrading
chapter</xref>.
</p>
<p>
Once you have the package management tools installed, you can use them
to install more software.
This is covered in the <xref chapter="packages">Installing Packages
chapter</xref>.
</p>
</preface>

<section name="bin"><title>Installing the Binary Distribution</title>
<p>
The binary distribution comes as a Mac OS X installer package (.pkg),
wrapped in a disk image (.dmg).
[FIXME: more]
</p>
</section>

<section name="src"><title>Installing the Source Distribution</title>
<p>
The source distribution comes as a standard Unix tarball (.tar.gz).
It contains only the <code>fink</code> package manager and its package
descriptions and will download the source for packages on the fly.
[FIXME: more]
</p>

Now that you have something that can be called a Fink installation,
this chapter shows you how to install the actual software packages you
came for.

<section name="bin"><title>Installing Binary Packages</title>
<p>
[FIXME: dselect, apt-get, and their relationship]

<chapter filename="upgrade">
<title>Upgrading Fink</title>
<shorttitle>Upgrade</shorttitle>

<preface>
This chapter covers the procedures used to update your Fink
installation with the latest and greatest stuff.
</preface>

<section name="bin"><title>Upgrading using Binary Packages</title>
<p>
[FIXME: no special procedure, just hit update in dselect or run
'apt-get update' and install as normal (apt-0.5.3-5 or later
required)]
</p>
</section>

<section name="src"><title>Upgrading the Source Distribution</title>
<p>
[FIXME: selfupdate (available in 0.2.5 and later) or download
packages-### tarball and run inject.pl, then 'fink update-all']
