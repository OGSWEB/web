 README for XML Documents
==========================

This directory and its subdirectories contain the XML source of the
various documents of the Fink project, plus the XSLT stylesheets used
to render them to HTML. You still need Saxon, an XSLT interpreter
written in Java. Download Saxon 6.2.2 from
<http://users.iclway.co.uk/mhkay/saxon/> and put the file 'saxon.jar'
in this directory. You can then use the provided Makefiles to render
the documents.
