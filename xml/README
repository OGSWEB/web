 README for XML Documents
==========================

This directory and its subdirectories contain the XML source of the
various documents of the Fink project, plus various XSLT stylesheets
for rendering:

 * finkdoc-website.xsl renders to HTML for the website. The script
   postprocess.pl adds the required PHP wrapper. Multiple pages /
   files are generated for <document> documents.

 * finkdoc-html.xsl renders to pure, monolithic HTML for inclusion
   with the distribution and for printing.

 * finkdoc-text.xsl renders to ASCII text via an intermediary XML
   format. The textify.pl script does the actual text rendering. This
   is also for inclusion with the distribution.

To render the documents, you still need Saxon, an XSLT interpreter
written in Java. Download Saxon 6.2.2 from
<http://users.iclway.co.uk/mhkay/saxon/> and put the file 'saxon.jar'
in this directory. You can then use the provided Makefiles to render
the documents. There are .cvsignore files to keep CVS from complaining
about generated files.
