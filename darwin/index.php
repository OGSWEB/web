<h1>Darwin Information</h1>

<p>In this section of the Fink website I want to collect useful
information on Darwin and Mac OS X that I learned during my
experiments. It is meant not just for Fink users, but for Darwin users
in general. Current installments:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="porting.php">Porting Hints</a> for porting Unix software
to Darwin</li>
<li><a href="gnome.php">GNOME on Darwin</a> - instructions and patches
needed to get the core GNOME packages up and running</li>
<li><a href="patches.php">Patches</a> for various packages - mostly
shared library support right now</li>
<li><a href="libtool.php">GNU libtool</a> and Darwin - how to get
shared libraries</li>
<li><a href="x11-choices.php">X11 Choices</a> - the various ways to
run X11 applications on Mac OS X</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, I don't have time to keep all of these pages
current. Check the 'Last changed' note on each page.</p>

<p>For more helpful stuff, check out the <a href="../links.php">link
list</a>.</p>
