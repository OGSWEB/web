<h1>The Fink F.A.Q.</h1>

<p>This is the list of frequently asked questions about Fink. Like in
most FAQs, some questions are taken from real life and some are made
up. It's really more like a documentation written in an ad-hoc,
question and answer style.</p>

questions are listed and linked in the table of contents below.</p>
