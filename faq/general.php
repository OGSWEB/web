<h1>Fink F.A.Q. - General Questions</h1>

<p><a name="what"><b>What is Fink?</b></a></p>

<p>Fink is actually two things in one (doesn't that sound great?
<tt>;-)</tt> ) - a compile-from-source package manager and a
distribution of Unix software for Mac OS X. The package manager is
built on top of dpkg, the binary package manager written by the <a
href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a> project. (Older
versions used GNU stow.)</p>

<p><a name="naming"><b>What does the name Fink stand for?</b></a></p>

<p>Nothing, it's just a name. It's not even an acronym.</p>
<p>Well, actually Fink is the German name for Finch, a kind of
bird. I was looking for a name for the project, and the name of the
OS, Darwin, led me to think about Charles Darwin, the Galapagos
Islands and evolution. I remembered a piece about the so-called Darwin
Finches and their beaks from school, and well, that's it...</p>
