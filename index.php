<p>Fink is an attempt to bring the full world of <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> and other Open Source software to
<a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/">Darwin</a> and <a
href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a>. Think of it as an
add-on distribution (in the Linux sense) for these systems.</p>

<p>Fink wants to be simple, functional and fully automated. GNU stow
is used to manage a separate directory tree. The fink package manager
downloads, configures, compiles and installs software from the
internet.</p>

<h2>Download</h2>

<p>Version 0.1.1 was released on 8 January 2001. You can grab it from
the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203">download
area</a> at SourceForge. This is a very early release, so be
careful.</p>

<h2>Porting</h2>

<p>I've compiled some <a href="porting.php">hints on porting</a> GNU
software to Darwin, including how to build GNU libraries as shared
libraries. I hope to add more stuff in the future.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>This project is hosted by <a
href="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>. Have a look at the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fink/">project summary</a> there
for bug tracking and other stuff. A <a
href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/fink-users">mailing
list</a> for users is also available.</p>
