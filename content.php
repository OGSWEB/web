<h1>About Content Markers</h1>

<p>Like Fink itself, this website has two basic audiences: Mac OS X
and Darwin (most of the time I'll just say Darwin) users that want to
use Unix software on their Mac, and users of other Unices that want to
use Fink as an add-on package manager for their system. There's also
some content on this site that applies to Darwin in general.

To make life easier for all of you, each page carries a marker at the
right end of the menu bar. It shows the focus of the page. Currently
there are:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="8">

<tr valign="top">
<td><img src="img/marker-general.gif" width="160" height="22"
alt="General content" /></td>
<td>
<p>These are pages like this one - they apply to all audiences.</p>
</td></tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td><img src="img/marker-darwin.gif" width="160" height="22"
alt="Darwin related" /></td>
<td>
<p>These pages contain information that applies to Darwin and Mac OS
X. It will probably not be useful if you use another Unix
variant.</p>
</td></tr>

</table>

<p>More markers will be added in the future as the site grows.</p>
