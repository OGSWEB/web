<p>Fink is an attempt to bring the full world of <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> and other Open Source software to
<a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/">Darwin</a> and <a
href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a>. Think of it as an
add-on distribution (in the Linux sense) for these systems. Once it is
more mature, I want Fink to evolve into a general package manager
suitable for all Unix variants.</p>

<p>Fink wants to be simple, functional and fully automated. GNU stow
is used to manage a separate directory tree. The fink package manager
downloads, configures, compiles and installs software from the
internet.</p>
