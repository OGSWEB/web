<h1>Darwin Information</h1>

<p>In this section of the Fink website I want to collect useful
information on Darwin and Mac OS X that I learned during my
experiments. It is meant not just for Fink users, but for Darwin users
in general. Current installments:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="porting.php">Porting Hints</a> for porting Unix software
to Darwin</li>
<li><a href="libtool.php">A libtool Patch</a> to build shared
libraries on Darwin</li>
</ul>

<p>For more helpful stuff, check out the <a href="links.php">link
list</a>.</p>
