<h1>Download Fink</h1>

<p>
Fink 0.2.4 was released on 1 August 2001.
It had a bootstrapping problem, which was corrected in Fink 0.2.4a,
released some hours later.
The two are absolutely identical in all other respects.
You do not need to upgrade to 0.2.4a if you successfully installed
0.2.4.

0.2.4a</a> - 500K, .tar.gz format</li>
</ul>

<p>
Installation and usage instructions are inside the distribution
tarball.
Please read them - Fink is not a one-click-and-done thing.
The documents README, INSTALL and USAGE are provided as pure text (for
reading from the command line) and as HTML (for reading in a browser
and for printing).
They are also available online in the <a
href="doc/index.php">documentation section</a>.
</p>

<p>
Older releases are always available from the Fink <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203">download
area</a> at SourceForge.
